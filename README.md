<H3>Description</H3>

Adobe After Effects is a popular program for editing video and dynamic images, 
creating compositions, various effects and animation.
It is most often used for processing video materials (post-production), 
creating music videos, commercials, animation, titles, and many other elements that require digital video effects.
Adobe After Effects offers excellent control functions, 
a wide range of creative tools, and the ability to integrate with other applications 
for processing video materials. Thanks to an extensive library of plug-ins developed 
by third-party companies, Adobe After Effects is also used in printing and graphic design 
for editing static graphic images (photographs, images created on a computer, etc.).
